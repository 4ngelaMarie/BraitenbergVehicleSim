 * \section Interface
 *
 * I have updated the code to include a factory interface. This interface allows for
 * light, food and braitenberg vehicle objects to be instantiated in the arena from 
 * a json file. The json file is submitted as the first paramater when exucuting
 * arenaviewer. 
 * 
 * I have also made changes to arena.cc to accomidate the factory interface.
